* [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download?WT.mc_id=lti-github-cxa)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7%3FWT.mc_id%3DltiAssessment-github-cxa)

## Useful acronyms

* **LMS** - Learning Management System - a software platform that helps to create, manage, and deliver learning courses. For example, Moodle, Open edX, Canvas, Blackboard and others.
* **LTI** - Learning Tools Interoperability - an education technology, which specifies a method for a learning system to invoke and to communicate with external applications. For example, [Assessment App](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureLTIAssessmentApp) and [Learn LTI](https://github.com/microsoft/Learn-LTI) applications use LTI protocol to connect with LMS.

## How to get started?

1. Make sure that you installed one of the LMS for demonstration and testing purposes.
2. Use the [Deployment Guide](/docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) to deploy the Assessment App on your Azure Subscription.
3. Use the [Configuration Guide](/docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md) to configure the Assessment App in your LMS.
4. Get familiar with application's [architecture](/images/architecturediagram.png), [Educator Guide](/docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md) and [Student Guide](/docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.md) to learn more about how the application works.
