# Azure LTI Assessment Application

## About

Most modern Learning Management systems (LMS), such as [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), [Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com) and [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas), support extensions using [LTI protocol](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) - an education technology, which represents a method for a learning system to connect with external applications.

**Azure Assessment App** is an LTI extension, implemented as a web application, which can be integrated into LMS using LTI protocol to allow Educators to easily create and manage assessments.

The Assessment App aims to reduce time spent by Educators on assessment management because it works independently from any LMS, provides a unified user interface and eliminates the need to transfer the questions from one format to another when switching between different LMS.

The project was started as a part of Microsoft and University College London Industry Exchange Network ([UCL IXN](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/collaborate/ucl-industry-exchange-network-ucl-ixn)) [Victoria Demina](https://github.com/victoriademina) under supervision of Dr. Graham Roberts (UCL) and Lee Stott (Microsoft) building of the [Microsoft Learn LTI](http://github.com/microsoft/learn-lti) Open Source Solution

The project was extended as part of Microsoft and University College London Industry Exchange Network ([UCL IXN](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/collaborate/ucl-industry-exchange-network-ucl-ixn)) by [Neha Ranade](https://github.com/neharanadee) under supervision of Dr. Graham Roberts (UCL) and Lee Stott (Microsoft) building of the [Microsoft Learn LTI](http://github.com/microsoft/learn-lti) Open Source Solution

## Key Features:

* **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - to access the Assessment App, users only need to sign into their institutionâ€™s LMS.
* **Participants and Grading** - the Assessment App securely retrieves the course participants from LMS and returns their grades back to LMS grade book.
* **Assessment Analytics** - illustrative insights for educators.
